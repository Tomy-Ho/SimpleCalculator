Project Description:<br>
A simple and easy project to get started into C# programing language. <br>
Goal of this project was to creat a simple calculator which uses simple arithmetic operations such as +, -, % ("Modulo"), ^ ("Power of..."), etc.<br>
In addition to that, the calculator should have a "history"-button, which shows all stored calculations that were entered before and a ","-button, which allows for calculations with decimal numbers.<br>
